My primary task involves compiling data for a study involving patients who have all been afflicted by the same illness. Throughout their treatment regimen, each patient responded to one of five medications: Drug A, Drug B, Drug C, Drug X, or Drug Y.

Part of my responsibility is to develop a model that can predict which drug might be most suitable for future patients who present with the same illness. The dataset encompasses various features including Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol levels of the patients. The target variable, which the model seeks to predict, is the specific drug to which each patient positively responded.

In this project, I intend to compare the effectiveness of different analytical methods, such as ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) and Tukey's test, to discern the most appropriate medication for patients. Furthermore, I will evaluate the accuracy of each method in determining the optimal drug for patients' treatment.
